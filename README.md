# Sharpe Ratio & Risk-Adjusted Portfolio Analysis

This project demonstrates quantitative finance concepts by analyzing **risk-adjusted returns** of individual stocks and portfolios using the **Sharpe Ratio**.  
It generates sample stock data, computes returns, and visualizes portfolio performance with multiple investment strategies.

## 🚀 Features
- Generate synthetic stock price data for multiple companies.
- Calculate daily returns, excess returns, and Sharpe ratios.
- Rank stocks based on their risk-adjusted performance.
- Compare portfolio strategies (Equal Weight, Top 3 Sharpe, Conservative, Aggressive).
- Create detailed visualizations:
  - Stock Price Evolution
  - Individual Stock Sharpe Ratios
  - Portfolio Strategy Sharpe Ratios
  - Risk vs Return Scatter Plot

## 📊 Visualizations
1. Stock Price Evolution Over Time  
2. Individual Stock Sharpe Ratios  
3. Portfolio Strategy Sharpe Ratios  
4. Risk vs Return Profile
